# Kiro Week 5 – The Local Guide

## Project Title
Bihar Local Street Food Guide using Kiro

## Problem
Visitors and newcomers often struggle to find authentic local street food
in Bihar due to lack of cultural and regional guidance.

## Solution
This project uses **Kiro** with a custom context file (`.kiro/product.md`)
to act as a **local guide** for Bihar street food and culture.

## Key Feature
- Local knowledge powered by `.kiro/product.md`
- Simple Python prototype
- Culture-aware responses

## How Kiro Helped
Kiro accelerated development by:
- Understanding local context from a custom file
- Reducing the need for complex logic
- Providing culturally relevant responses
